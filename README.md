dotfiles
========

This is my dotfiles repo. Nothing big.. yet!

Installation
============

If you want to use my dotfiles (which is kind of weird considering their current state), then just follow these steps:

```terminal
git clone git@github.com:Zoneur/dotfiles.git
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake
```

I am new to this Rakefile thing, so the script may not be the best of all...
